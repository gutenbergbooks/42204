<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Europe and Asia there are two countries
separated from each other by a narrow strip
of water. One of these is spoken of as
Turkey in Europe, and the other as Turkey
in Asia. They are held together under one
ruler called the Sultan. He has absolute
power over his people, and can do with
them as he likes. One word from his lips
is enough to cause the death of any of his
subjects. None dare to disobey him.</p>

<p>It is because his rule is not the best and
wisest, and also because his kingdom is always
in danger from the countries around it, that
the Sultan is often spoken of as "The Sick
Man of Europe."</p>

<p>Our little Turkish cousin lives in the city
of Constantinople, not far from the Sultan's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
palace. He does not understand why some
of his people live in wealth and luxury, while
so many others spend their lives in begging
for the food and clothing they must have.
He has no thought but that the Sultan of
Turkey is as great and noble as the ruler
of any other land.</p>

<p>The child is brought up to love ease and
comfort, the daintiest food and the richest
clothing. He feels sorry for the poor and the
homeless, but he does not know how to truly
help them. He hears little about other countries
where every one is free and can claim
just treatment as his right. But as he grows
older he may, perhaps, think for himself, and
do some noble deed to save his country and
make his people better and happier.</p>

<p>Let us open the doors of our hearts to him,
and let him feel our love and sympathy.</p>

<h2>Our Little Turkish Cousin</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>OSMAN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course Osman cannot remember his first
birthday. He is a big boy now, with brown
eyes and soft, dark hair. Ten years have
rolled over his head since he lay in the
little cradle by the side of his mother's
grand bedstead.</p>

<p>He made an odd picture,&mdash;this tiny baby
in cotton shirt and quilted dressing-gown.
His head was encased in a cap of red silk.
A tassel of seed-pearls hung down at one
side. Several charms were fastened to the
tassel. His mother thought they would keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
harm and danger away from this precious
baby boy.</p>

<p>He could not have felt very comfortable.
His nurse had straightened out his arms and
legs, and bound them tightly with bandages.
After dressing him, she placed him in his
little bed and covered him with several
quilted wrappers. Last of all, a thin, red
veil was spread over this little Turkish baby.</p>

<p>Do you think he could have enjoyed himself
very much? I don't.</p>

<p>He was ready for visitors now. First of
all, the proud and delighted father must
come in to see his child. A boy, too! The
grave man was doubly pleased when he
thought of this. As he looked for the first
time upon the tiny form done up in so many
wrappers, he could hardly tell whether the
boy was big or little, fat or thin.</p>

<p>He bent down over the cradle and lifted
the child into his own strong arms. Holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
him tenderly, he carried him from the
room. He stopped just outside the door.
There he stood for a few moments while he
repeated a short prayer and whispered the
name "Osman" three times in the baby's
ear.</p>

<p>This was the only christening the Turkish
boy would ever receive. Osman would be
his name for the rest of his life; and a fine
name it was, his mother and friends all
agreed.</p>

<p>When the baby was three days old, there
was a grand celebration at his home.</p>

<p>Certain old women, called "bringers of
tidings," went from one house to another
where the lady friends of Osman's mother
had their homes. Wherever they stopped,
these old women left bottles of sherbet made
of sugar-candy, spices, and water. As they
presented the sherbet, they told of the good
news about the new baby, of the name his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
father had given him, and of the feast to be
held at Osman's home.</p>

<p>"Do come, do come. You will surely be
welcome. You will be glad to see the child
and rejoice with his mother."</p>

<p>In this way the invitations were given; and
so it happened that many ladies found their
way to Osman's house on the day named.
No special hour was set for their visit. But,
from morning till night, people were coming
and going.</p>

<p>It was easy enough for passers-by to know
something of interest was taking place inside.
They could hear the band of music playing
lively airs as the ladies drove up to the
door and entered the house.</p>

<p>All the visitors wore long cloaks, with veils
over their faces, hiding everything except their
soft, dark eyes. For it is still the fashion
in Turkey that no lady shall be seen away
from her home with her face uncovered.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Very few of these visitors came alone.
They were attended by their slaves and servants,
laden with baskets. These baskets
were very pretty. They were trimmed with
flowers and ribbons, and filled with all sorts
of delicious sweets.</p>

<p>Of course they were presents for the new
baby's mother. She lay in her grand state
bed, smiling softly as the ladies came up, one
by one, to greet her. Before they entered her
chamber, they took off their veils and cloaks
in an outside room.</p>

<p>"Mashallah! May the child live long and
be happy," said the visitors, as they bent over
the young mother. At each kind wish, she
kissed the hands of the speaker. This was
her way of thanking them. Strange to say,
the ladies seemed hardly to notice the baby
himself, in whose honour they had come to
the house.</p>

<p>Do not think for a moment they had forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the tiny bundle done up in quilted
cotton. No, indeed. But the anxious mother
believed some bad fortune might come to
Osman if he were examined too closely. She
would worry if her friends should fondle the
child or pay him much attention.</p>

<p>This is the reason most of them pretended
not to see him. A few, however, were so
curious they could not resist stopping for a
moment at the cradle. But, instead of saying,
"Oh, the darling little fellow!" or, "What
a bright-looking child!" or other kind words,
they exclaimed, "The ugly little creature!"
"What stupid eyes he has!" or some such
unpleasant thing.</p>

<p>Would you believe it? Osman's mother
seemed really pleased as she listened. She
said to herself, "Well, if they praised my
child, I should think they were trying to hide
some bad wish. That very wish would bring
an accident to my darling, sooner or later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
No, I like best to hear them speak as they do.
I know they do not mean what they say."</p>

<p>The visitors were in no hurry to leave
Osman's home. They made themselves comfortable
on the soft couches. They laughed
and chatted together while they ate ices and
rich cakes, and sipped coffee or sherbet.</p>

<p>The refreshments were of many kinds, for
the baby's father was rich and held a high
office under the Sultan, as the ruler of Turkey
is called.</p>

<p>If Osman had been born in a poor family,
his parents would have had a celebration just
the same. The feast would not have been as
rich, but coffee and fruits would have been
served, at any rate, and the visitors would
probably have enjoyed themselves just as
much.</p>

<p>When Osman was eight days old, there was
another great ceremony at his house. He
received a bath. The ladies who were invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
could join in the bath if they liked, as well
as his mother. There would be music and
refreshments and a general good time.</p>

<p>The baby was bathed first. His mother's
turn came next.</p>

<p>A Turkish bath is not like that of other
people, as perhaps you have heard. A long
time is spent before it is finished. On
this great day in Osman's life, it was even
longer than usual. Many songs were sung,
and the visitors stopped several times to eat
refreshments.</p>

<p>All this sounds odd to us, but the rich
ladies of Turkey have little to do except to
ride and make calls, bathe in their own homes
or at the public bath-houses, meet together
for picnics or some entertainment.</p>

<p>Osman grew so fast it seemed to his mother
only a short time before he was able to toddle
about without the help of his nurse. The
carpets were soft and thick, so he did not get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
hurt even if he fell. The beautiful colours of
the carpets amused his baby eyes.</p>

<p>He was awake every morning soon after
sunrise, but this did not trouble his parents.
They were early risers, too. The boy's father
liked to have plenty of time for sipping
coffee and smoking his pipe before leaving
home for the day.</p>

<p>There was no such thing as breakfast. The
family ate only two real meals in the whole
day. But the early morning was a pleasant
time. There was no jumping up from the
table after a hasty meal. There was no rushing
for the train after a hurried kiss and goodbye
to wife and baby. Oh, no, none of these
things are done in Turkey.</p>

<p>Osman's father dressed himself in a comfortable,
loose gown, and seated himself cross-legged
on a rug. He clapped his hands and
a slave appeared with the steaming coffee,
which was placed on a low stand near by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Then the baby's mother poured out the coffee
and, handing it to her husband, sat down
on a cushion at his feet.</p>

<p>Osman, still in his nightclothes, toddled
about, nibbling a sweet-cake.</p>

<p>The slave who had brought the coffee
was now busy in tidying the room. First
of all, mattresses and wadded coverlets must
be stowed away in a cupboard. There was no
bedstead. Such a clumsy piece of furniture
had been used in the house but once. That
was when the young mother lay in state to
receive her friends when Osman was born.</p>

<p>Would you believe it! the baby's mother
was still wearing her wadded night-dress. She
often kept it on for hours after she got up
in the morning.</p>

<p>"It is so comfortable," she thought.
"Why should I hurry to dress myself for
the day?"</p>

<p>After the coffee, the father took his pipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and lighted it with a tiny piece of charcoal.
Now for a comfortable smoke. As he puffed
away at his pipe, the room was quiet except
for little Osman's prattle. He was trying
to tell his father and mother about his play-things.</p>

<p>After a while the sober Turk laid down his
pipe, and said, "It is time for business."</p>

<p>The dressing-gown was taken off, and street
clothes were put on. What a grand-looking
gentleman he was now, with his long beard
hanging over his snow-white shirt-front, his
embroidered vest, and wide, loose trousers.</p>

<p>He lifted Osman up for a kiss, and, with a
deep bow to his wife, he left home for the day.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SCHOOL</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mamma</span>, mamma, I am so glad it has
come at last!" said little Osman, early one
bright spring morning.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my darling," answered his mother.
"It is a good time; I am glad, too."</p>

<p>What made Osman wake up sooner than
usual this morning? What caused his eyes to
look so bright? Why was the nurse taking
such pains with his hair and dress?</p>

<p>He was going to school for the first time in
his life. His sixth birthday had come and
gone, and his father had said:</p>

<p>"It is time for my little boy to do something
besides play. He must learn to read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
our good books, and understand the use of
numbers."</p>

<p>The important day was set and the teacher
was told about the new pupil. Word was
also sent to the priest.</p>

<p>Osman's father spent some time in choosing
a pony on which his boy should first ride to
school. At last he decided on one of an iron-gray
colour and very handsome.</p>

<p>"What beautiful trappings!" exclaimed Osman,
when the pony arrived at the door.
"Oh, you dear, kind father to get them!"</p>

<p>Any boy would be pleased to ride on a
pony decked out in such a gay manner.</p>

<p>The pony had no sooner arrived than the
whole school appeared at the door. The
children were dressed in their best clothes to
do honour to the new pupil.</p>

<p>The priest took his place in front of the
young company. They instantly bent low
while he made a short prayer. After this, Osman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was lifted to the back of the pony, the
other children formed in double line, and the
procession started out for the school.</p>

<p>But it did not move quietly. Hymn after
hymn was sung by the little ones in strong,
clear voices as they went along.</p>

<p>The grown-ups whom they passed smiled
and said to themselves, "A child is on his
way to school for the first time. It is
a glad day. May he grow wise and be
happy."</p>

<p>What an odd-looking schoolroom it was
that Osman soon entered; neither seats nor
desks could be seen. Three divans, as the
big, soft Turkish couches are called, stood
along the wall. The children squatted cross-legged
on these, side by side.</p>

<p>After they had taken their places, the
teacher sat down in front of his little class and
began to hear their lessons.</p>

<p>Each child had by this time opened his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
book and begun to recite. Not one of them
at a time. Oh, no, indeed! They spoke together
in high, sharp voices. How could the
schoolmaster understand what they said?</p>

<p>He did not seem to have any trouble, however,
and kept the children busy. They read
from the Koran, which is the sacred book of
their people, they recited numbers, and they
wrote.</p>

<p>You remember they had no desks. The
poor little things had to hold their copy-books
in their laps, and it was tiresome work. Their
pens were made of reeds, and sponges took the
place of ink-wells.</p>

<p>Before the children were dismissed, the
master told them a story which interested Osman
very much.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="Osman kneeling on floor in front of grandmother" />
<span class="caption">OSMAN AND HIS MOTHER.</span>
</div>

<p>"I will repeat it to my mother," he said to
himself. "The story teaches us not to seem
surprised, no matter what may happen. My
father has spoken of this very thing. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
polite to be astonished. That is what he has
often said."</p>

<p>As the little boy rode homeward, he saw a
man sitting cross-legged at the street corner.
Two veiled women stood in front of him.
They were eagerly watching the man as he
wrote. From time to time he stopped as one
of the women told him something more she
wished him to put into the letter.</p>

<p>"He is a street scribe," thought Osman.
"They will pay him for that letter. They do
not know how to write. That is why they get
him to do it. How quickly he makes the
letters, and how easily he holds his pen. I
hope it won't be long before I can write as
well as he does."</p>

<p>Such a scribe is often seen in the streets of
Constantinople, the city where Osman lives.
There are many people there who can neither
read nor write. Fine ladies are not ashamed
to stop at a scribe's little stand and ask him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
write letters for them, as these people were
doing.</p>

<p>Osman's school was only a short distance
from home, and he was soon at his own gate.
The moment he arrived, the door was opened
by an old black slave, who had been watching
for the darling of the house.</p>

<p>"I'd like to stop and tell you what
I've been doing this morning, but I can't
now," said Osman. "I must tell mother
first."</p>

<p>The little boy ran up the stairs to his
mother's rooms. In another moment he was
seated on a divan beside her and talking faster
than one often hears among the quiet people
of his country.</p>

<p>Lunch was soon brought, and, you may be
sure, the little boy was ready for it. There
was a dish of pilaf, of course. It was made of
nicely cooked rice and butter, and was delicious.
Then there was a juicy melon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
fresh figs, besides cakes sweetened with honey,
candy, and many other nice things.</p>

<p>Osman's mother is as fond of sweet things
as her little boy, and she is ready to eat them
at any time. The lunch was served at an odd
little table. Indeed, it could hardly be called
a table,&mdash;it was a small, low stand, about
eight inches above the floor. The dishes were
brought in one at a time, and placed on the
stand.</p>

<p>Osman and his mother ate the pilaf with
their fingers, from the same dish. But they
did not hurry. The grains of rice were picked
up so daintily with their finger-tips, they were
hardly soiled by the touch of the food.</p>

<p>"We will wash now," Osman's mother
said, as the lunch was finished. A queer basin
was at once brought by a servant, and held in
front of the lady. In the middle of the basin
was a little stand holding a cake of soap, while
underneath was a sort of well. This was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
receive the water as it left the basin. As
Osman's mother held out her hands, one
servant slowly poured the water over them,
while another held an embroidered towel ready
for her use.</p>

<p>It was Osman's turn next. No matter how
much he wished to hurry out to play, he must
not rise from his cushion till his hands were
bathed.</p>

<p>"Wash before eating and afterward," is
a law of the Koran. Osman thinks it would
be as wicked to break this rule as to tell a
wrong story, or take anything belonging to
another.</p>

<p>As soon as the hand-washing was over, the
little boy started for the courtyard to watch
his tame pigeons and play with his friend
Selim.</p>

<p>Osman's house is divided into two parts.
His father's rooms are down-stairs. A separate
door leads into them from the street. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
woman ever enters these rooms. Even the
servants who take care of them are men.
The boy's father receives his gentlemen friends
in this part of the house. It is here that
he talks over business with his visitors.
Sometimes he holds dinner-parties in these
rooms, but they are only for men. He even
has a separate courtyard and garden. Osman
may come here if he likes, but the real
home of the family is up-stairs in his
mother's rooms.</p>

<p>This part of the house is very beautiful.
Rich curtains hang in the doorways. Soft
and heavy rugs are placed here and there
on the floors. Divans with soft cushions
stretch along the sides of the walls, under
the latticed windows.</p>

<p>Yes, every window is covered with lattice-work,
so that no one passing along the street
below can see the faces of the persons within
these upper rooms.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the fashion of the country. Poor
women of Turkey! They seem to us almost
like prisoners, but they have been brought
up to think of their life as the most natural
and best in the world. They may go outdoors
whenever they like, so long as a veil
is worn over the face. But no man, unless
he is a very near relative, must enter the part
of the house where the women and children
have their home.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FIRE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Listen</span>, listen, Osman. What is all the
noise about?" exclaimed Selim. It was
toward the end of the afternoon, and both
boys were growing tired of play.</p>

<p>"It's a fire. Don't you see the police?
They are hurrying along with pails of water
on their heads. Then, look quickly down
the street! Smoke is coming out of that
building. Let's ask nurse to go with us."</p>

<p>In another moment Osman had run into
the house and out again, with old black Fatima
trotting after as fast as she could move. She
hurriedly pulled her veil over her face. Then,
taking each boy by the hand, she led them
through the gate, and joined the crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
people who were going in the direction of the
fire.</p>

<p>Everybody looked gay and happy. Why
shouldn't they have a good time? The fire
did not happen through any fault of theirs.
It would be a grand sight, and the onlookers
might as well enjoy it.</p>

<p>There were no fire-engines in the city. The
policemen brought pails of water, but these did
little good.</p>

<p>And now, not only columns of smoke are
bursting through the windows and doorways,
but flames are leaping and dancing along the
openings. See! Those who are still inside
the burning house are throwing out cushions
and mats, curtains and pillows, into the street.
Such furnishings can be saved, even if the
building is destroyed.</p>

<p>The watching crowd seize these articles and
at once make themselves comfortable. A
number of women sit down on a pile of soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
rugs and prepare to enjoy the show, as if they
were at the theatre. Not far off is a group of
men, who stand chatting and smoking. The
balconies of neighbouring houses are filled with
gazing crowds.</p>

<p>The street peddlers soon begin to arrive.
They bring trays of sweetmeats, sherbets, and
other good things. As they elbow their way
through the crowd, they act as though the fire
had been started on purpose to give them a
chance to sell their goods.</p>

<p>Still the fire rages; the timbers creak; the
walls begin to totter; the roof gives way, and
falls inward with a crash. In a few moments
more, only a heap of charred wood is left in
the place of a fine house.</p>

<p>It might have been saved if firemen could
have been here with their engines. But they
are unknown, as yet, in this great city of the
Turks, where many buildings are destroyed by
fire every year.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come, children," said Fatima, "it is
late. The shadows are beginning to fall.
Osman, your father is surely home by this
time and will wonder where you are."</p>

<p>While the old woman hurried the boys
along, they ate fig-paste they had bought
of a peddler.</p>

<p>No doubt you, children of other lands, have
eaten fig paste, too. But perhaps you have
never thought of the people who invented it.
It is a Turkish sweetmeat, and Osman thinks
it is delicious when freshly made by a candy
merchant in his city.</p>

<p>"The fire has waked up every dog in this
quarter," said Fatima, fretfully, as she hurried
the children along. She was right in saying so,
for "Bow-wow-wow, bow-wow-wow," could be
heard in every direction. Even as she spoke,
the old nurse stumbled against a big dog that
was rushing past her and barking furiously.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, old fellow! Catch him, catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
him!" cried Osman, turning around to watch.
"Fatima, don't you see what is the matter?
He is driving a strange dog out of the street.
I hope he will succeed."</p>

<p>Just as Osman spoke, a half-dozen other
dogs came tearing along, eager to join in the
chase. There was small chance for the stranger,
who was now running with all his might. His
tongue was hanging from his mouth, and his
tail was thrashing from side to side between
his legs.</p>

<p>Poor homeless dogs of Constantinople!
There are thousands of them. Yes, it is the
very truth. There are scores of thousands of
them.</p>

<p>Those big, gaunt, yellow creatures live in
the streets and byways, under the door-steps
and in the graveyards. They feed on the
garbage thrown out from the kitchens, but
sometimes get a little choicer food through the
kindness of the people.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kill a dog without real need of doing so!
No, no," Osman's father would say, very solemnly.
"It is the law of our religion that we
should kill nothing living if we can possibly
help it. Let the dogs live.</p>

<p>"Besides, they are useful creatures. They
keep our streets clean of all decaying matter.
By doing this, fevers and many other kinds of
illness are prevented. The poor animals are a
real blessing."</p>

<p>"I know where there are some new-born
puppies," said Selim, as he was leaving
Osman for the night.</p>

<p>"Where? Let's go and see them now. Is
it near here?" cried his little friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's only a few steps."</p>

<p>"No, no, children," broke in Fatima, "you
ought to be in your own homes this very
moment. Wait till morning, and I will go
with you before school-time."</p>

<p>"Are their eyes open yet? Does their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
mother seem fond of them? How many are
there?" asked Osman.</p>

<p>But Fatima did not give Selim a chance
to answer. She had already rung the bell at
the door of his house, and a servant had
appeared to take charge of him.</p>

<p>So, without stopping for anything except
a kind wish to Selim for his peace and happiness,
she led her own little charge home. His
father had reached there before him, and was
all ready to talk over the day's doings with
his only child.</p>

<p>As the Turk sat smoking that evening,
Osman described the fire he had seen, and
told of the hunted dog he had met on the way
home.</p>

<p>"He ought to have known better than to
come into a strange quarter," said the boy.
"It was all he could expect. Any dog that
remains at home is not troubled by the
others. I love the creatures; don't you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
papa? They are gentle and quiet and
clever."</p>

<p>"Yes, Osman, the city would not seem like
home without our yellow-haired dogs. Before
you were born, however, the Sultan thought
it would be wise to clear our streets of them.
Great numbers were taken to an island near
the coast."</p>

<p>"Did they die there from want of food,
papa?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. They were too wise to stay
there and starve. They all swam back to the
city. Our people were so pleased, the dogs
have never been troubled since then."</p>

<p>"I love the dogs because they are not only
gentle, but they do not forget a kindness.
They are grateful creatures," said Osman's
mother. "I have a friend who told me the
story of an English lady living here in our
city. She had a small terrier she had brought
back with her after a visit to England.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose, Osman, you know that our
dogs are always ready to attack one of a
different breed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma."</p>

<p>"Well, it happened one day that this little
terrier escaped from his home and got out
into the street among the dogs of the city."</p>

<p>"Did they kill him?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. But they had a reason for
being friendly to him. The English lady and
her family had always been kind to them,
and had often fed them. Not only this, but
she had seen that pans of water were placed
in the street on hot days, so the dogs
should not suffer from thirst. They were
grateful to her, and seemed to feel that her
pet terrier was also a friend.</p>

<p>"After this, the lady allowed her dog to
play with the others as much as he liked.
He was always well treated. But he did not
have sense enough to keep in his own street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
One day he wandered off into another quarter,
and he was instantly attacked. His dog
friends heard the noise and rushed after him.
When they got to him, he was surrounded on
all sides by his enemies.</p>

<p>"It would have gone hard with him, if one
brave friend had not seized him by the neck
and rushed home with him. He did not stop
till he reached the lady's house, where he
dropped the terrier on the door-step.</p>

<p>"Even then, he and his comrades did not
go away. There they waited till the owner
appeared, when they tried to explain, as well
as poor doggies can, what had happened."</p>

<p>"What noble fellows they were," said
Osman, when his mother had finished the
story. "I shall love them more than ever."
Then the little boy went on to tell of the
family of puppies Selim had discovered.</p>

<p>"I will go to see them early to-morrow
morning, and will carry some food to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
mother," he said. "I love puppies. They
are beautiful little things, and their hair is as
soft as silk."</p>

<p>Osman loved pets as much as any other
boy in the wide world, and he was always
ready to take a family of puppies into his
heart. His parents taught him, however, that
it was not good to handle them. "The dog
is an unclean animal," said the boy's father.
"Be kind to him and love him, but touch
him as little as possible."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PICNIC</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a beautiful summer day. The sun
was shining brightly on the glossy leaves of
the olive-trees in Osman's garden, and the
plants were loaded with blossoms.</p>

<p>Osman had just picked a bunch of flowers
when he heard his mother's voice.</p>

<p>"How would you like a day by the Sweet
Waters of Europe, my child?"</p>

<p>The little boy looked in the direction of the
voice. His mother was moving slowly down
the garden path.</p>

<p>"That would be lovely, mamma, but can't
Selim go with us?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, and I have sent word to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of my friends to join us, too. We will have a
merry time. I am tired of the house, and I
long for a row on the beautiful river. Let
Fatima go for Selim, and make yourself ready
at once."</p>

<p>The little boy's mother was already dressed
for the excursion. So, while the servants were
preparing the lunch and Osman was getting
ready, she sat down on a cushion under the
trees and idly waited.</p>

<p>She was richly clad in a pink silk mantle
with wide sleeves and deep cape. It was so
long it reached down to her ankles.</p>

<p>A small, bright-coloured cap, trimmed with
pearls, was fitted closely to her head. The
thin muslin veil, fastened to this cap, was
brought around her face so no part of it could
be seen except her soft, kind eyes.</p>

<p>She did not have long to wait before her
friends and Selim arrived to join in the day's
outing. The slaves, with wraps and carpets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
were also ready, and, at a sign from their mistress,
the party started out.</p>

<p>How queerly the ladies walked! They
waddled along in a clumsy fashion with their
skirts tucked up under their mantles and
around their waists. They looked like shapeless
bundles moving along in loose trousers
and clumsy overshoes.</p>

<p>It was only a few steps to the waterside,
where boats were waiting for them. The
boatmen first helped the ladies to get in and
seat themselves on soft cushions; next came
the two boys, and, last of all, the servants.</p>

<p>When every one was comfortably settled,
and umbrellas had been raised over the ladies'
heads to protect them from the strong sunlight,
the men bent to their oars and they were off.</p>

<p>The boats were light and very graceful.
They were of a kind the Turks call kaiks.
They sped onward through the water as the
men gave long, strong pulls at the oars.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>On and on they went, now rapidly as the
river widened; again, they moved more slowly
as they entered a narrow stretch of water,
almost filled with the boats of other pleasure-seekers.</p>

<p>Sometimes they were obliged to pass under
a little wooden bridge. Then it was fun for
Osman and Selim to reach up and see if they
could touch the floor of the bridge before
they left it behind them.</p>

<p>Pretty houses stood here and there on the
banks of the river, or groves of trees that
seemed to say, "Stop here and rest awhile. I
will give you shade and comfort."</p>

<p>But still the rowers kept on, as though their
arms would never get tired. They did not
speak, these sober-faced men. Each wore a
red fez on his head, which made him look hot
and uncomfortable in the strong sunshine.</p>

<p>There was a time when all Turks wore soft
turbans, which are the best and most comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
covering for the head. But times are
changed now. The great Sultan likes the fez
best, and the turban is seen more and more
seldom as the years pass by.</p>

<p>At last the party reached a spot where
Osman's mother decided to stop. It was a
favourite picnic-ground for the people of Constantinople.
A pretty grove of trees was
growing close to the shore, while, near by, tiny
coffee-houses stood here and there in the
meadows.</p>

<p>"I hear sweet music," said Osman. "Listen,
mamma."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a wandering player. After we
get settled, we will pay him to play for us,"
answered his mother.</p>

<p>The ladies made themselves comfortable on
the rugs their servants spread under the trees.
The children wandered about as they liked.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i057.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="Ships in front of large city" />
<span class="caption">&quot;IT LOOKED ALMOST LIKE A FAIRY CITY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Sweet Waters of Europe" is a good name
for this part of the river. It was a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
place, and everything about them looked fresh
and inviting.</p>

<p>"Osman, let's see what that man is showing,"
cried Selim, after the boys had listened
to some music and eaten the ices they had
bought at a stand.</p>

<p>The children joined a crowd of people
gathering around a showman.</p>

<p>It was a puppet-show, something like the
Punch and Judy one sees in England and
America. But the funny little figures acted
out a very different play. It must have been
amusing, for every one laughed heartily.</p>

<p>Before the day was over other showmen
came along, each with a different exhibition of
his own. Then there were men who performed
tricks, and others who had candies and
dainties to sell.</p>

<p>As for the ladies, you must not think
they sat quietly on their mats all day long.
Oh, no indeed! They laughed and romped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
they sang and danced, they ate candies and
cakes as freely as the children themselves.
The serious ways of the city were quite
forgotten.</p>

<p>But at last the shadows of evening began
to fall.</p>

<p>"Come, come, we must start for home,"
cried Osman's mother. "I must certainly be
home by sunset to greet my husband."</p>

<p>They made haste to start, and in a few
minutes they had taken their places in the
boats and were moving back toward the great
city.</p>

<p>As it came into view once more, it looked
almost like a fairy city. The soft light of the
late afternoon bathed the tall spires and minarets,
which reached up toward the sky like
long, slender needles.</p>

<p>Here and there were grand buildings of
white marble, while the whole place was
dotted with groves of dark cypress-trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, it looked very, very beautiful, but
when the boats were left behind, and the
narrow, dirty streets were reached again, it
did not seem possible it could be the same
place the party had seen from the water.</p>

<p>There was no likeness to fairy-land now.
The hungry dogs, the ragged beggars, the
tumble-down houses in the very midst of the
fine buildings, make the stranger feel sad.</p>

<p>But Osman is so used to these sights, they
do not trouble him. This city, the greatest
one of his people, always seems grand and
beautiful to him.</p>

<p>On the evening after the picnic, Osman's
mother said to her husband, "I have invited
a party of my friends to lunch with me
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The Turks do little visiting after sunset.
The ladies often spend the day with each
other, but are seldom away from home at
dinner-time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, after their master had
gone away for the day, and Osman had started
for school, the servants began to make ready
for the party.</p>

<p>As soon as the first guest arrived, a pair
of shoes belonging to Osman's mother was
placed outside the door of her room. If
her husband should happen to come home
during the day, he would see these shoes.
He would know by this sign that his wife
had lady visitors. It would not be polite
for him to enter her rooms during their stay
in the house.</p>

<p>The lunch-hour soon came. The hostess
led her friends into the dining-room. They
seated themselves on the soft cushions placed
by the servants around the low stand.</p>

<p>There was a spoon, and also a piece of
bread, at each lady's place. On the centre
of the stand was a leather pad on which hot
dishes would be set as they were brought in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
But when the ladies sat down there was no
food to be seen, except the pieces of bread,
some saucers containing olives, bits of cucumber,
melons, and radishes.</p>

<p>And now the slaves moved from one guest
to another, bringing a basin of water and
towels. Each one must bathe her hands before
eating, as well as afterward, whether alone
or in the grandest company.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to watch them. As the
stream of clear water fell slowly into the
basin, each one rubbed her fingers gracefully
and daintily, and then dried them on the fine
linen towel held out by the watchful servant.</p>

<p>When this had been done by every one,
Osman's mother clapped her hands, and a
tureen of thick, creamy soup was brought in
and set on the leather pad.</p>

<p>The hostess politely waved her hand toward
her principal guest. She was inviting her to
be the first one to dip her spoon into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
soup. After this, the other ladies joined in,
all eating together from the same dish.</p>

<p>After a few mouthfuls, the hostess made
a sign to the slave to remove the soup and
bring in another dish. Before the meal was
over there would be sixteen courses, at least,
and, therefore, it would not be well to eat
much of any one of them.</p>

<p>The guests ate a little of every course.
But, between the courses, they nibbled at
the olives, cucumbers, and different sweetmeats.</p>

<p>More than once, Osman's mother broke
off a choice bit of food with her fingers, and
held it up to the mouth of one of her friends.
It was a very polite attention, and her visitor
was pleased.</p>

<p>"How rude some people in the world are
about eating," said one of the ladies. "They
use the most clumsy things in their hands.
They call them knives and forks. And besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
I have heard they do not wash before
and after each meal. Ugh! It makes me
shiver to think of their unclean ways."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are certainly not neat, and they
are very awkward, if all I have heard about
them be true," said another visitor. "They
should study the ways of our people."</p>

<p>At last the luncheon was ended. The
hostess led the way into the drawing-room,
where coffee was now served.</p>

<p>They were having a merry time, laughing
and chatting, when Osman entered the room.
His face showed he had something he wished
to tell. Making a low bow to the ladies, he
turned to his mother and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, I just saw a cat fall ever so
far. She was on the roof of that old building
behind our house. She fell down, down to
the ground. And, mamma, I thought she
would be killed. But she came down softly
on her feet and ran off as if she hadn't been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
hurt the least bit. How is it that a cat can do
such a thing? No other animal is like her,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>His mother laughed, and turned to one of
her friends. "Won't you tell my little boy
the story of Mohammed and the cat?" she
asked. "We should all be pleased to listen,
and perhaps there are some here who do not
know it."</p>

<p>The rest of the company nodded their
heads. "Yes, do tell it," said one after
another.</p>

<p>"Very well, little Osman," said the lady
whom the boy's mother had asked. "You
shall have the story. I trust you will remember
it whenever you think of the Holy
Prophet.</p>

<p>"Mohammed once travelled a long, long
distance over the desert. He became very
tired, and at last he stopped to rest. As he
did so, he fell fast asleep.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, sad am I to tell it, a wicked
serpent glided out from among the rocks and
drew near the Prophet. It was about to bite
him, when a cat happened to come along.
She saw the serpent and what it was about to
do; she rushed upon it and struggled and
fought. The serpent defended itself with all
its strength and cunning, too. Great was the
battle. But the cat killed the snake.</p>

<p>"As it was dying, the wicked creature hissed
so horribly that the noise awakened Mohammed,
and he saw at once that the cat had
saved his life.</p>

<p>"'Come here,' he said. As the cat obeyed
him, the holy man stroked her lovingly three
times. Three times he blessed her, saying
these words:</p>

<p>"'May peace be yours, O cat. I will
reward you for your kindness to me this
day. No enemy shall conquer thee. No
creature that lives shall ever be able to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
thee on thy back. Thou art indeed thrice
blessed.'"</p>

<p>"And is this the reason a cat always falls on
her feet?" asked Osman.</p>

<p>"Even so, my little friend. Perhaps after
this story you will feel more loving toward
those soft-footed creatures," said the lady.</p>

<p>Osman made a low bow and thanked her
for her kindness in telling the story. He was
about to leave the room when another of the
visitors reached out her hand and softly patted
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sit down beside me, my child. I have
a story to tell the company. Stay and hear it,
if your dear mother is willing."</p>

<p>"May I, mamma?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Osman, if you are good and
quiet."</p>

<p>The little boy at once settled himself beside
the lady who had asked him to stay. This is
the story he heard.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />THE WOOD-CUTTER AND FORTUNE</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a wood-cutter
who lived in the forest with his wife and two
children. He was very poor. Day after day,
and year after year, he went out into the midst
of the wood and worked hard chopping down
the trees and cutting them up for fire-wood.</p>

<p>After he had cut all the logs he could fasten
upon the backs of his two mules, he went with
them to the nearest town and sold his wood.</p>

<p>As each year came to an end, the poor wood-cutter
was no richer than he was at the beginning.
When twenty such years had passed by,
he began to feel quite hopeless.</p>

<p>"What is the use of working so hard?" he
said. "Perhaps if I stay in bed from morning
until night, Fortune will take pity on me. I
will try it, at any rate."</p>

<p>The next morning, therefore, the wood-cutter
stayed in bed, as he had promised
himself he would do. When his wife found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he did not get up, she went to wake
him.</p>

<p>"Come, come," she cried, "the cock crowed
long since. You are late."</p>

<p>"Late for what?" asked her husband.</p>

<p>"Late for your work in the forest, to be
sure."</p>

<p>"What is the use? I should only gain
enough to keep us for one day."</p>

<p>"But, my dear husband, we must take what
Fortune gives us. She has never been very
kind to us, I must admit."</p>

<p>"I am tired and sick of the way she has
treated us. If she wishes to find me now, she
must come here. I will not go to the wood
to seek her any more."</p>

<p>When she heard these words, the woodcutter's
wife began to weep bitterly. She
thought of the empty cupboard. She was
afraid of hunger and cold.</p>

<p>Neither his wife's pleadings nor her tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
had any effect on the wood-cutter. He would
not rise from the bed. In a little while a man
came to the door of the cottage, and said:</p>

<p>"Friend Wood-cutter, will you help me
with your mules? I have a load to move."</p>

<p>But the wood-cutter would not get up. "I
have made a vow to stay in my bed, and here
I shall stay," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then, will you let me take your mules?"
asked the neighbour.</p>

<p>"Certainly, help yourself," said the wood-cutter.</p>

<p>The neighbour took the mules and went
away. It happened that he had found a rich
store of treasure in his field, and he needed
the mules to carry it for him to his home.</p>

<p>But, alas for him! The animals were safely
loaded and had nearly reached his house,
when some armed policemen came that way.
The man knew the law of the Sultan, by
which he claimed all treasure-trove for himself.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>There was only one thing for him to do,
that is, if he did not wish to be killed for
taking the treasure for himself. He must
flee.</p>

<p>Away he ran as fast as he could move, leaving
the mules to go where they chose.</p>

<p>You can easily guess they turned toward
their own home. They soon reached it in
safety.</p>

<p>When the wood-cutter's wife saw them
standing in front of the door with their heavy
loads, she rushed to her husband and begged
him to get up and look into the matter.</p>

<p>But he still refused.</p>

<p>He had vowed to stay in bed till Fortune
should visit him, and stay he would.</p>

<p>His wife, seeing something must be done,
went out to the mules and began to cut the
cords binding the sacks.</p>

<p>Of course you know what happened then.
Out fell a perfect shower of gold pieces. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
ground was soon covered with a golden carpet,
richer than the most precious stores of the
great East.</p>

<p>"A treasure! A treasure!" cried the
woman, as she rushed to her husband's bedside.
"Fortune has truly come to our
home. Husband, you did right in waiting
for her here. Look and see how rich we
are now."</p>

<p>It was certainly time for the wood-cutter
to get up, for he had kept his vow. As
he looked at the piles of gold pieces, he
said:</p>

<p>"I was quite right, dear wife. One must
wait for Fortune. She is very fickle. You
will never catch her if you run after her. But,
if you wait for her, she will surely come to
you."</p>

<p>When the story was ended, one of the
ladies pointed to the clock.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," she said, turning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Osman's mother, "I have had a most delightful
day. But it is now late in the afternoon.
I must bid you farewell."</p>

<p>As she rose to go, the other ladies followed
her example, each one thanking the hostess for
the pleasant day spent with her.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GIPSIES</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I wish</span> you had been with me this afternoon,
Osman," said his father, as his little
boy ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"What did you see, papa? Please tell me
all about it."</p>

<p>"I went to walk with a friend. We wandered
on and on until we came to a large field
near the city walls. The field was alive with
gipsies, who were having some sort of a holiday.
They were dressed in their gayest colours
and were having a dance."</p>

<p>"Outdoors in that field, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Osman, and it was a very pretty sight.
A number of the men were squatting on the
ground in a circle. Those were the musicians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
They played on different kinds of instruments.
There were drums, flutes, and mandolins.</p>

<p>"The players banged away with no kind of
time, but the gipsies seemed to enjoy it, notwithstanding."</p>

<p>"How did they dance, papa?"</p>

<p>"The men kept by themselves, each one
moving separately. But the women danced
together. They all beat time with their hands.
At the same time they kept saying, 'Oh, Oh,
Oh,' as they moved about.</p>

<p>"When the dance was ended, the gipsies
went over to a corner of the field where a feast
was being prepared. Great fires had been
kindled. Huge kettles of rice were boiling
there, and whole sheep were being roasted.</p>

<p>"Many of the young gipsies were handsome.
Their eyes were dark and sparkling,
and their teeth were of a pearly white. But
the old women were wrinkled and ugly. Their
long, thin fingers made me think of witches."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"The gipsies dress in the old style of our
country, don't they, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you always see them with large, baggy
trousers, short jackets, and turbans wound
around their heads. The men wear bright-coloured
waistbands, stuck full of pistols and
daggers."</p>

<p>"I feel scared, papa, only to hear you speak
of such things."</p>

<p>"How foolish that is, Osman. The gipsies
would do you no harm. They mind their
own affairs pretty well. To be sure, we do
not love these people, but there is nothing to
fear from them.</p>

<p>"They have chosen to live among us, and,
although they go away in large companies and
travel all over Europe, they are sure to come
back here."</p>

<p>"Where did they come from in the first
place, papa?"</p>

<p>"A long time ago, I believe, they lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the far East, or in Egypt. They speak a
queer language, made up of Hindi and Greek,
as well as Turkish words."</p>

<p>Just then, Osman's mother came into the
room.</p>

<p>"Father has just been telling me about a
feast held by the gipsies this afternoon,
mamma."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And did any of the women offer
to tell you your fortune?" asked the lady, as
she turned toward her husband.</p>

<p>"They were having too good a time among
themselves to notice any outsider," he answered.
"At any other time I should have
been bothered by them. I can't tell you how
many times this year I have been asked to
show the palm of my hand and cross it with
silver."</p>

<p>"The silver is the pay for the fortune-telling,
isn't it?" asked Osman.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i079.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="woman reading another woman's palm" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;SHE TOLD ME HE WOULD BE MY HUSBAND.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Certainly; a gipsy wouldn't give you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
moment of her time unless she were paid for
it," said his mother.</p>

<p>"When I was a young girl, I loved to have
my fortune told. One day a beautiful young
gipsy girl came to the door of my house. Of
course, she asked to tell my fortune.</p>

<p>"I spread out the palm of my hand and she
looked at it a long time with her bright black
eyes. She seemed to study the lines as though
she were reading. At last, she began to speak
slowly in a low voice. And, would you believe
it! she described your father, Osman, although
I had never seen him at that time. She told
me he would be my husband."</p>

<p>Osman's father smiled a little and then said,
"The less we have to do with these strange
people, my son, the better. It is very easy
for these fortune-tellers to make one or two
guesses that afterward turn out to be true.
But we have talked enough about the gipsies
for one day. Let us speak of something else."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then tell me about our great ruler, whom
you serve," said Osman. "I like to hear
about the palace and the Sultan's little children
who live in a city of their own inside of our
great one."</p>

<p>The people of Turkey seldom speak of
Osman's city as Constantinople, the name
given it by the Christians. They prefer to
call it "The Town."</p>

<p>"Yes, the palace and the buildings belonging
to it really make a city by themselves,"
said his father. "It is a beautiful place, with
its lovely gardens and parks. There is a lake
in the midst of the park, and the Sultan sometimes
sails around it in an elegant steam
launch.</p>

<p>"The palace is of white marble, as you
know, Osman. The furniture is of ebony
inlaid with ivory. The curtains and carpets
are of the brightest colours, and are rich and
heavy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is a theatre, as well as a great many
other buildings, isn't there, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Osman. It is decorated in the richest
colours. The Sultan's seat is in the front
part of the gallery."</p>

<p>"He has many children, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he loves them dearly. He often
spends the evening with them and plays
duets on the piano with his favourites. The
building where they live with their mothers is
in the park. I have been told it is very
beautiful."</p>

<p>"The Sultan has many, many wives, I have
heard mother say."</p>

<p>"It is true. And each wife has a great
number of slaves as well as other attendants.
Sometimes his wives drive through the city in
elegant carriages."</p>

<p>"But the Sultan never leaves the palace
grounds, except on the two great times each
year, does he?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never, except at those times, Osman.
But any one can get permission to see him
as he rides on horseback to the mosque in his
grounds, where he worships."</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful sight, papa. You know
you have taken me there to see him. The
lines of soldiers, all in red fezzes, reach from
the door of the palace to the snow-white
mosque. The Sultan himself looks so grand
as he rides along!</p>

<p>"The troops cheer him as he passes them
and enters the mosque, but everybody else
is very, very quiet. I suppose they feel somewhat
as I do, papa. I'm not exactly afraid.
But he is such a great and powerful ruler,
it doesn't seem as if I could move or make
a sound while I look at him."</p>

<p>Dear little Osman! Our far-away cousin
has never heard how the people of other
countries speak of Turkey. They call it the
"Sick Man of Europe." They think it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a pity the Sultan has such power in the land.
They say:</p>

<p>"Turkey is the only country in Europe
that does not believe in the Christian faith.
Its most important city is on the shores of
a strait through which a great deal of trade
is carried from all parts of the world. These
are some of the reasons different countries
would like to get control of Turkey and its
great city. They all look toward it with
longing eyes.</p>

<p>"Besides these things, the Sultan himself is
not a good ruler for his people. He has
many wives and hundreds of slaves. Many
of his people follow his bad example and buy
slaves, both black and white."</p>

<p>But little Osman knows nothing of what
is said about the Sultan and the people of
his land. It has never entered his head that
it is wrong to buy and sell human beings.</p>

<p>His mother is kind to her slaves, and does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
not make them work hard. Sometimes, too,
she frees one of her slave women. They are
happy, she thinks.</p>

<p>"But, dear little Osman," you would say,
"it is the <i>right</i> of every one to be free. Perhaps
when you grow up you will see this, and
help to make things different in your country."</p>

<p>Let us go back now to the little boy and his
father as they sat talking of the Sultan and
his palace.</p>

<p>"He dresses very plainly," said the Turk.
"But in the old days, the ruler's garments
were very rich, and his fez fairly blazed with
diamonds. If you had lived then, Osman,
your eyes would have been dazzled when you
looked at him."</p>

<p>"I wish I could have seen some of the
things my grandmother has described," answered
his son. "But I'm glad I wasn't
living during the revolution of the janizaries.
Everybody must have been scared then.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it really true that Sultan Mahmoud's
old nurse saved his life by hiding him away in
an oven?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he wasn't Sultan then. He was
the heir to the throne, however."</p>

<p>"What made the trouble, papa?"</p>

<p>"Sultan Selim III. was a wise ruler. He
wished to improve his country. At one time
the janizaries were the best trained and most
useful troops. They were chosen from the
Christians who were taken captive in war.</p>

<p>"But after awhile, men with no training and
with selfish motives managed to get into their
ranks. Sultan Selim knew they were harmful
to the Empire, and intended to disband them.
They found out what he was about to do,
took the city and palace by surprise, and
killed the good Selim.</p>

<p>"As soon as his son's old nurse heard the
uproar, she hurried to Mahmoud and said,
'Come with me at once; your life must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
saved.' She led him to an old furnace in the
palace and begged him to get inside.</p>

<p>"'No matter what happens, nor who calls
your name, do not make a sound until I speak
to you,' she told him.</p>

<p>"He did as she said. Hour after hour, he
stayed quietly inside the furnace while his
father and many of his friends were being
cruelly killed.</p>

<p>"The Sultan's enemies hunted everywhere
for him, but he was nowhere to be found.
They called his name coaxingly, but he knew
better than to answer any one else than his
old nurse, so he did not make a sound.</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile, the old woman was
patiently watching. When the janizaries had
gone away, she went to the door of the furnace
and whispered to Mahmoud. She told him
he now had a chance to gather his men about
him and seize the government.</p>

<p>"There was not a moment to lose; Mahmoud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
was quite a young man, but he had a
strong nature. His wonderful eyes showed
that.</p>

<p>"He came out from his hiding-place and
succeeded in gaining control of the city. The
wicked janizaries were conquered, but Mahmoud
had a sad and troubled reign. Blessed
be his memory!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A TURKISH BATH</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Osman</span>, you may go with me to the
public bath-house," said his father, one bright
morning. "I have business at the bazaar to-day,
and we will go there afterward. You can
have a good bath."</p>

<p>Osman was delighted. A whole day with
his father was a great treat. Besides, it pleased
him to think of a visit to the public bath-house.</p>

<p>There was a large marble bath-room in his
own home, and there were furnaces underneath
to heat it. There were servants to wait upon
him as he bathed. "Yet the public bath is
better still," thought Osman, "and I love to
go there." Probably you have all heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Turkish baths. They are so delightful that
people in America and other countries have
copied them from the Turks. They have
built similar bath-houses in their cities.</p>

<p>"Are we to drive or walk, papa?" asked
Osman.</p>

<p>"We will drive. The carriage will be here
in a few moments."</p>

<p>After a short drive they drew up in front of
a large and handsome building. It was the
public bath-house.</p>

<p>The first room entered by Osman and his
father was a large hall. It was open overhead
to let in the fresh air. There was a raised
platform around the sides. This platform was
covered with a soft carpet and divided into
small dressing-rooms. Each visitor would
have one of these for himself.</p>

<p>A fountain was playing in the middle of the
hall, making sweet music as the water fell into
the marble basin.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go into one of those little rooms and
take off your clothing, Osman," said his
father.</p>

<p>The little boy was soon ready for the bath.
The attendant had wound three bright-bordered
towels around him. One of these was
tied about his waist, the second was twisted
into a turban around his head, while the third
one was thrown over his shoulders. He
would not catch cold, for the towels were
thick and warm. He wore wooden slippers
on his feet.</p>

<p>Now for the warm chamber.</p>

<p>Osman knew what was coming. He went
at once to the marble platform in the middle
of the room. There he stretched himself
on a soft mattress which the attendants placed
for him.</p>

<p>They began to rub his feet and limbs very
gently. How pleasant and restful it was!
The little boy soon began to perspire. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was the time for moving him into a still
warmer room, called the hot chamber.</p>

<p>Here Osman was rubbed briskly with a
camel's-hair glove after a bowl of water had
been poured over his body.</p>

<p>"Oh, how good this is," he thought,
sleepily, when scented water was brought in,
the attendant using the soft fibres of the palm
in bathing him with the fragrant water. It
was very, very pleasant.</p>

<p>There was no hurry. Hot clothing was laid
on the boy when this last bathing was over;
cold water was poured over his feet and he
was taken to the cooling-room. Here he
could lie on a soft, pleasant couch as long as
he wished.</p>

<p>After a good rest, how the blood danced
through every part of his body! Tired! It
did not seem as though he could ever be tired
again in his life. He was ready for any
amount of walking and sightseeing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father," he said, as they left the building
and turned into one of the busiest streets, "I
think a bath is one of the pleasantest things in
the whole world."</p>

<p>"It almost makes a new man out of an old
one," answered the serious Turk.</p>

<p>He never called himself a Turk, however.
He would feel insulted to hear us speak of
him in that manner. He would say, "I am
an Osmanli, that is, a subject of the empire
founded by Osman."</p>

<p>Osman, the founder of the empire, is also
called Otman, so the subjects are sometimes
spoken of as Ottomans, and their country as
the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>Now let us go back to our little Osman and
his father.</p>

<p>"See that poor beggar," whispered the little
boy. "May I give him a coin, papa?"</p>

<p>It was a sickly-looking old man who filled
Osman's heart with pity. He was very dirty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and his clothes were torn and ragged, although
they were gay with bright colours. As he
leaned against the side of a fountain, he
made a picture you would like to paint.
He kept crying, "Baksheesh, baksheesh," to
the passers-by.</p>

<p>What a beautiful fountain it was! It had a
wide roof, giving a pleasant shade. There
were gilded gratings all around it, worked in
lovely patterns,&mdash;roses and honeysuckles and
trailing vines.</p>

<p>Brass drinking-cups, hanging around the
sides, seemed to say, "Come, thirsty traveller,
come and drink."</p>

<p>What a fluttering and cooing there was over
the roof. At least a hundred pigeons were
flying about, fearless and happy. No one
would harm them, not even the ragged street
boys who were playing about the fountain and
ready for any mischief.</p>

<p>After Osman had given a silver coin to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
beggar, his father pointed to the fountain, and
said, "Look, my child, at the beautiful pattern
of the grating."</p>

<p>"How pretty the gilded flowers are," answered
Osman. "I love to see them. But,
papa, there are ever so many fountains in our
city. Nearly half of them are as pretty as this
one. I believe there is hardly a street without
one."</p>

<p>"I knew a very good man who died a few
months ago. He left his money to be used in
building a fountain. It was a kind deed.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, papa. There are always people
and animals who are thirsty. It is a comfort
to have fresh water at hand, especially if it
is a warm day."</p>

</div>

<p>As Osman was speaking, he heard a sound
of music. Looking down the street, he saw
two gipsies coming toward him. The man
was playing on a bagpipe, and leading a tame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
bear. The woman was dressed in bright
colours. She was beating a tambourine.</p>

<p>"Isn't it pretty music, papa? Oh, do look
at the bear," cried Osman. "He is doing
some tricks."</p>

<p>His father was in no hurry, so he and
Osman joined the crowd who gathered around
the gipsies. The bear danced in time to the
music, and did other amusing things.</p>

<p>Osman tossed him a coin, which he carried
to his master. This pleased the others, and
they threw him some more coins.</p>

<p>"At this rate, the gipsies will go home
to-night quite rich," laughed Osman's father,
as they passed on. "We will go to the bazaar
now. I must attend to some business there
before it is much later."</p>

<p>"See that man with the tiger's skin over his
shoulders," said Osman, a few minutes later.
"He is clothed in rags, but he isn't a beggar,
is he?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, indeed, Osman. He is without doubt
a wise man of our own faith, who prefers to be
poor. He has probably come to the city
to visit some holy tomb, in order to keep a
vow he has made. He may have travelled
many hundreds of miles. You should honour
him, my little boy."</p>

<p>Osman and his father still moved through
the crowd of busy people. They passed many
Greeks and Armenians, who carry on a large
share of the business of the city. There
were also Englishmen and Americans, who
were seeing the sights of this strange, lively
place.</p>

<p>There were serious-looking Mohammedan
priests in white and green turbans, with their
eyes bent down to the ground. There were
water-carriers with big jars on their backs, and
sweetmeat-sellers with scales on which they
were ever ready to weigh out the rich candies
of Turkey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>As for dogs and beggars, there were hundreds
of them, without a doubt.</p>

<p>"There is the bazaar, papa. I can see it
on the hilltop beyond us."</p>

<p>It was an immense building of a brownish
gray colour. You might almost call it a city
in itself.</p>

<p>As Osman and his father began to climb the
hill, they made their way between many stands
and tiny booths where goods were for sale.
Everything looked inviting, and Osman saw
several things he wished to buy.</p>

<p>"See those lovely grapes, papa. I should
like to carry some of them home," said the
boy. But his father would not stop.</p>

<p>"We will not buy anything till we reach
the bazaar," he said. "You will see enough
there to tempt you, I do not doubt."</p>

<p>They passed on, and soon reached the
entrance of the great building. It was quiet
and dark inside, and there were many narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
little streets or passages, through which hundreds
of people were moving. Each narrow
passage was given up to the sale of some
special thing.</p>

<p>The shopkeepers were from many different
countries. There were shrewd Armenians,
wily Greeks, Persians with big caps on their
heads, and Turks with long beards, squatting
comfortably by their counters.</p>

<p>The high roof was over all. Light was
given by great numbers of little domes shining
in every direction through this city of shops.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant to Osman. He liked
to watch the crowds and look at the many
lights. He enjoyed the strange odours of the
East. He never grew tired of looking at the
rich and beautiful goods for sale,&mdash;the goods
of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Three continents
seemed to meet in the great bazaar of
Constantinople.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, please look at these lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
stones. I should like to buy that necklace for
mamma, she is so fond of amber."</p>

<p>But the boy's father replied, "Not to-day,
Osman, not to-day."</p>

<p>Some queerly wrought swords now caught
the boy's eye. They were made of the
finest steel, and the handles were richly
ornamented.</p>

<p>"How I wish I could have one of those for
my very own, papa. Mayn't I please have
one?"</p>

<p>"When you are a young man, Osman, we
will look for the most elegant sword to be
bought. But not now, my child."</p>

<p>Osman forgot his longing for a sword when
he stood in front of a stand where perfumes
were sold.</p>

<p>"We will buy some of this attar of roses.
It will please your mother, and you may give
it to her," said the father.</p>

<p>The Turks are fond of delicate perfumes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and there is none they like better than attar of
roses, which is largely made in Turkey, and
sent from there to other countries.</p>

<p>"Why does it cost so much?" asked
Osman, as his father handed a gold coin to the
shopkeeper.</p>

<p>"It is because only a few drops can be
obtained from hundreds and hundreds of the
flowers. Next year, you shall take a journey
with me, Osman. I am going to the part of
our country where the roses are raised for this
purpose. It is a beautiful sight,&mdash;the fields
thickly dotted with the sweet-smelling blossoms.
You shall then see how the people get
fragrant perfume from the flowers."</p>

<p>"I'm getting so hungry, papa. Can't we
get some lunch? That cheese makes my
mouth water."</p>

<p>A man with a round wicker basket containing
different kinds of cheese was going
through the street and calling his wares.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush, Osman." His father pointed to
the tower of a small mosque.</p>

<p>High up in this tower stood a man crying
out to all faithful believers of Mohammed.
It was the call to prayer.</p>

<p>Five times each day this prayer-caller
mounted the tower. Each time he cried out to
the people who were within reach of his voice.</p>

<p>Osman and his father instantly turned
toward the sacred city of Mecca, and, kneeling
down right where they stood, repeated a short
prayer.</p>

<p>Then they slowly rose and turned their
steps toward a restaurant, where they could
get a delicious lunch.</p>

<p>There were many other peddlers in the
streets besides the cheese-seller. Some of the
shoppers bought what they wished from these
peddlers. They could get unleavened bread
or biscuits, custards, ices, sherbet, sweetmeats,
hot vegetables, and many other things.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>But Osman's father said, "We can be more
comfortable in the restaurant. Besides, I should
like a good dish of kebaby."</p>

<p>Kebaby! It was an odd name and an odd
dish.</p>

<p>"It is very, very good," thought our little
Turkish cousin, as he began to eat from the
steaming soup-plate set before him.</p>

<p>The cook had placed tiny squares of unleavened
bread in the bottom of the dish.
Over this he had poured a quantity of sour
cream, and last of all came little squares of hot
meat. The dish was seasoned with salt, pepper,
cardamom, and sumach.</p>

<p>"Good! Yes, very good," said Osman's
father, as he tasted the kebaby. "There is
nothing I like better."</p>

<p>When the lunch was over, he and his little
son went to that part or the bazaar where
carpets were sold. After many words about
the price, a beautiful rug was purchased. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
colours were soft and rich. It was woven so
closely it would last for many years. The
shopkeeper had said it would be good for a
lifetime, and he probably spoke the truth.</p>

<p>"Before we go home, will you take me out
on the bridge of boats?" asked Osman. "It
isn't far from the bazaar."</p>

<p>"Aren't you too tired?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; the bath this morning made
me ready for anything."</p>

<p>A short walk brought Osman and his father
to the bridge of which he had spoken. It
joins the main city of Constantinople and the
suburb of Pera.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem as though the bridge could
be made of boats until we look over the sides,
does it?" said Osman.</p>

<p>"No, dear. They are firmly chained together
and covered with such strong planks
that this bridge seems like any other. I
must say I like to come here, myself. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
can get such a fine view of the Golden
Horn."</p>

<p>"Why do people call our harbour the Golden
Horn?"</p>

<p>"It is shaped somewhat like a horn. Besides
this, it is the channel through which
many shiploads of the richest goods are carried.
Think of the precious things you saw in the
bazaar to-day, the beautiful gems, the spices,
the silks, the shawls of camel's hair."</p>

<p>"I understand now. But look! There is
a camel with a heavy load on his back. His
master is leading him. I love camels."</p>

<p>"When I was a little boy," said his father,
"my mother used to tell me stories of the old
times. In those days there were none of the
new-fashioned carriages in our streets. Only
the gaily trimmed arabas, and sedan-chairs
carried on men's shoulders could be seen."</p>

<p>"Mamma sometimes goes in a sedan-chair
now," said Osman. "It must be a warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
way of riding in summer-time, though. The
close curtains keep out the air."</p>

<p>"You would have liked to see the camels in
the old days, Osman. Merchants often travelled
through the streets with whole processions
of those animals. They went very slowly,
to be sure, and they blocked up the streets.
But camels are steady, faithful creatures, and
are good beasts of burden."</p>

<p>"The dress of the people was much prettier
long ago, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, it was. It is a shame so many of
our people copy the fashions of other countries.
The dress now looks stiff and ugly beside the
loose robes and bright colours of the old times.
But see, my child, the day has left us and I
am tired. We must hasten homeward."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE WEDDING</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I wish</span> I could have been there," thought
Osman.</p>

<p>It was Friday morning, and the little boy
was sitting beside his mother while she described
the wedding-festival given in honour of
two dear friends. She and her husband had
spent all day Thursday at the bridegroom's
house.</p>

<p>"It was a grand time, my little son. I wish
you could have enjoyed it with us, but you
were too ill to leave home," said Osman's
mother, as she lovingly patted his cheek.</p>

<p>"Was there a great crowd, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, for the young couple have
hosts of friends. The ladies, of course, rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in carriages, and the men were on horseback.
A band of music played lively tunes as we
escorted the young bride to her new home.</p>

<p>"When we reached the house, the bridegroom
stood waiting in the doorway. He led
his bride to the bower in the bridal chamber,
and, leaving her there, went to the 'place of
greeting' to receive his gentlemen friends."</p>

<p>"You helped in making the bower, didn't
you, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I went to the new home on Monday,
with other friends and the relatives of the
bride. The wedding-outfit and the presents had
already been brought by some trusty porters.</p>

<p>"After we had refreshed ourselves with a
lunch of coffee and sweetmeats, we began to
decorate the bridal chamber. We hung the
bride's pretty dresses, her shawls and prayer-carpet,
her embroidered sheets and towels, on
cords fastened along the walls.</p>

<p>"Then we chose one corner of the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
for the bower. We hung up fine embroideries
and festoons of gauze, and fastened numbers of
artificial flowers here and there in the draperies.
When it was done it was lovely!"</p>

<p>Osman's mother sighed with delight as she
thought of it.</p>

<p>"But our work did not stop there, my dear.
Oh, no. We placed the most precious wedding-presents
in glass cases, so every one could
see and admire them. Then we hung garlands
of flowers on the walls of the room. It was
very beautiful now.</p>

<p>"When this room was finished, we went
into the next one and set up the new furniture
and bedding, the beautiful candelabra, the smoking-set,
and the kitchen ware."</p>

<p>"What did you do on Tuesday, mamma?"</p>

<p>"We went with the bride to the bath.
When it was over, she put on borrowed clothing.
Some bad fortune might come to her, if
she did not follow this old custom."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"You spent Wednesday with the bride, too,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Osman. That is a very important
day in the wedding-festival. I went to the
bride's house quite early in the day, for we are
very close friends. I helped her in receiving
the bridegroom's mother and other relatives.
All her special friends gathered there with me.
We formed in a double row and helped the
other guests up the stairs.</p>

<p>"I hope my dear Morgiana will be good
friends with her new mother. As they sat
side by side, the old lady passed sugar from
her own mouth to that of her daughter-in-law."</p>

<p>"Why was that, mamma?"</p>

<p>"It was a token of the good feeling there
will be between them, Osman."</p>

<p>"Dear me, a wedding-festival is a grand
thing, isn't it? I wish I could have gone
Thursday with you and papa. That was the
greatest day of all."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it was a very pleasant time for every
one. There was an entertainment in the place
of greeting for the men, and another for the
women in the bride's rooms. Some gipsy
girls danced and sang for us and we had
refreshments."</p>

<p>"What was the bride doing all this time,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"As soon as the bridegroom had led her to
the bridal bower and gone away, her veil was
raised. We could now look at her beautiful
face as much as we liked, and admire her
wedding-gown and presents."</p>

<p>"Did many poor people come in to look at
the pretty things?" asked Osman. His voice
was rather sad as he said the word "poor."
He pitied those who did not have a lovely home
like himself, and plenty to eat and to wear.</p>

<p>"It is so hard to be poor and have to work
hard from early morning till late at night," he
often thought.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Osman. The house was
filled with people all day long. No one was
turned away from the door," answered his
mother. "I saw women in shabby clothing
standing beside the most richly dressed ladies.
They seemed to enjoy the festival very much."</p>

<p>"When did the bridegroom enter, mamma?"</p>

<p>"As soon as the evening prayer had been
recited in the 'place of greeting.' Then the
bridegroom hurriedly left his men friends and
started for the bridal bower."</p>

<p>Osman began to laugh. "I know what the
men did then, mamma. I have heard papa
tell about it. They pelted the bridegroom
with old shoes and struck his back many a
sharp blow. No wonder he hurried up-stairs
as fast as he could go."</p>

<p>The boy's mother smiled. "And I can
tell you what happened after the door closed
behind him, although we visitors now took our
leave. I well remember my own wedding.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"The bride kissed his hand as he entered.
He knelt down on her veil and made a short
prayer. After this a mirror was held in front
of the young couple by an old woman friend
of the bride, so they could see their faces in it
side by side.</p>

<p>"Then sugar was passed from the young
man's mouth to that of the bride. It was a
symbol of the sweetness of their future life.</p>

<p>"But, my dear child, I have been so busy
talking I did not notice the time. I must
leave you to dress for the banquet at the home
of our young friends. Run away and play
with Selim."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CHILDREN'S CARNIVAL</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Selim</span>, Selim, you will be late if you don't
hurry," called Osman.</p>

<p>He himself had been ready for five whole
minutes, and was becoming impatient because
his little friend was not in sight. So he ran
across the street to Selim's house to find out
what was the matter.</p>

<p>"I will be dressed in a minute or two," said
Selim. Osman sat down to count his marbles
while he waited.</p>

<p>The two boys were going to a children's
carnival in the grand courtyard of a certain
mosque. Their mothers would go with them.
Hundreds and hundreds of children would
gather there to make the most of this glorious
spring day.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Osman had looked forward to this festival
for a long time.</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful?" he exclaimed, when he
and Selim, with their veiled mothers, entered
the courtyard and joined the crowd of happy
little people.</p>

<p>The children played one game after another.
The boys had their tops and marbles, and did
many wonderful things with them. Of
course, refreshments were plentiful; there were
delicious sweetmeats, sherbets, and other
things the children loved. And all the time
the mothers, sitting on their gay carpets,
watched the boys and girls at their play, and
seemed to enjoy it as much as the little ones
themselves.</p>

<p>"I have had <i>such</i> a good time," Osman told
his father that evening. "Papa, do you remember
when you were a little boy like me,
and went to children's carnivals?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as if it were only yesterday, my dear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Yet many years have passed away since I
romped with my boy friends and played with
tops and marbles. But I have something else
to speak of, Osman. Would you like to go
with me to-morrow to the mosque of Agia
Sophia?"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, yes, indeed. I love to go with
you anywhere. But it is so beautiful there, I
shall be more glad than usual."</p>

<p>Osman's people use the word "mosque"
as we do the word "church." Mosque means
the place of prayer. The Turks build all
their mosques in the same general way. They
ornament them with domes and high-pointed
spires called minarets.</p>

<p>When you visit Osman's home, you will
see hundreds of these domes and minarets, for
there are many mosques in his city.</p>

<p>"Papa, where is the oldest mosque in the
world?" asked Osman.</p>

<p>"It is at Medina, in Arabia, on the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
spot chosen by the great Prophet himself. A
part of it is kept open to this day for all homeless
people. That is, if they are believers in
Mohammed. They can go there at any time
and live in its shelter. It was the Prophet's
wish."</p>

<p>"It would be nice if every mosque were like
that one," said Osman. "When I grow up,
I hope I may go to Medina and stand in the
Mosque of the Prophet. He suffered very
much, didn't he, papa?"</p>

<p>"A great, great deal," Osman's father
sighed. "He received his teachings direct
from Heaven. We find those teachings in the
Koran, our sacred book.</p>

<p>"Mohammed had many enemies who believed
he was cheating his followers. They
did not believe that Allah (God) taught him.
They even said bad spirits were the cause of
his teachings. His life was in danger many
times. But he and his teachings were saved."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/i121.jpg" width="339" height="500" alt="view of mosque through archway" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE MOSQUE AT LAST.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Osman's father bent his head, saying these
words very slowly: "Allah is great, and
Mohammed is his Prophet."</p>

<p>Osman repeated them after him. Then
both father and son sat quiet for a few
minutes. When the Turk spoke again, he
said:</p>

<p>"It is bedtime for my little boy. Good
night, my child." He bent down and kissed
Osman, then motioned to his waiting nurse to
go with him to his room.</p>

<p>The next day was clear and beautiful.
Even the street dogs seemed quieter and
happier than usual.</p>

<p>"It is good to be outdoors in the bright
sunshine," said Osman, as he walked down
the street with his father. They came in sight
of the mosque at last. It was not beautiful to
look at, but it was very, very large.</p>

<p>"Once there were no minarets rising from
this mosque toward heaven," the boy's father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
told him. "Only the great dome reached
upward from the roof. That was when the
Christians ruled over our city and worshipped
in this building. But when it came into our
hands, many changes were made."</p>

<p>"Why do we call it 'Agia Sophia,' papa?"</p>

<p>"It is sacred to 'Wisdom,' my child. The
way to wisdom must be through prayer. But
here we are at the doorway."</p>

<p>Osman and his father hastily took off their
shoes and put on the big, soft slippers handed
them by an attendant. Other people, who
were about to enter, did the same thing.</p>

<p>There was a good reason for this. The
dust of the street must not be brought
in to soil the floor or carpets. They must
be kept clean. During the service the people
bow their heads to the floor itself many
times.</p>

<p>"It always makes me wish to be quiet when
I go there," Osman once told his mother. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wonder how men could ever build such a great,
great place of worship."</p>

<p>There were no altars, no images, no seats.
But along the walls, there were slabs of marble
of all sorts and colours. Pillars of rare and
beautiful stones held up the roof.</p>

<p>"They have been polished so they shine
like mirrors," thought Osman, "and they are
as beautiful as gems."</p>

<p>The floor of the mosque was strewn with
prayer-rugs. They were arranged so the people
who came to worship might all kneel
toward the sacred city of Mecca.</p>

<p>"It is hundreds of years since Christians
worshipped here," Osman's father had once
told him. "They had altars of solid gold and
shrines sparkling with precious jewels. Pictures
of their saints were on the walls. But
we, Osman, are taught not to have such paintings.
A mosque should have no pictures of
human shapes, nor of any other. For it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
written: 'Thou shalt not make the likeness
of anything.'</p>

<p>"When the great Sultan who conquered the
Christians took possession of the city, he rode
through this very building. It was crowded
with people who had fled here for safety.
The Sultan ordered that no blood should be
shed. But he made the Christians the slaves
of himself and his people.</p>

<p>"He changed the building into a place of
worship fit for followers of Mohammed, saying,
'There is no God but Allah, and
Mohammed is his Prophet.'"</p>

<p>"What was done with the altars and the
images and paintings, papa?"</p>

<p>"The altars and images were torn down.
The walls were covered with a coating of reddish
plaster, even as you see them to-day, and
this hid the pictures from sight."</p>

<p>"I love to come here in Ramazan. The
brightness dazzles my eyes. I wish I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
count the great wheels of light hanging from
the ceiling at that time."</p>

<p>Ramazan is the only part of the year when
the mosque is brightly lighted. It is a strange
festival, and lasts a whole month.</p>

<p>The days are given up to fasting, and the
nights to services in the mosques, to feasts, and
frolics. It is the only time in the year when
Osman's mamma leaves her home after the sun
has set, and goes to evening parties of her friends.</p>

<p>All through the month, the streets are alive
each evening with lights and processions and
gay parties. But from dawn to sunset the
followers of Mohammed must eat no food
whatever, although they may feast all night
long if they wish to do so.</p>

<p>Rich people, such as Osman and his family,
enjoy turning day into night for a while. But
it is not so easy for the poor, who must work
without eating through the whole day, no
matter how hungry and faint they may become.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TWO FRIENDS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Never</span> forget your friends, Osman. I am
glad you are so fond of Selim, although his
family is poor. I hope you will always love
him as you do now."</p>

<p>"Of course, papa. Selim is just like my
brother. He always will be, too."</p>

<p>Osman looked up at his father with a little
surprise. Forget Selim! He could not
imagine such a thing.</p>

<p>"You ought to feel that way," said his
father. "There is nothing so beautiful as
friendship. I will tell you a true story
about two boys who once lived in this very
city."</p>

<p>Osman, with a happy smile, squatted on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
rug by his father's side. There was nothing
he liked better than a story.</p>

<p>"One of these boys," said the father, "was
the son of a rich tobacconist. He was a
Moslem, like ourselves, but his dearest friend
was a little Armenian, whose father was a poor
bread-seller and a Christian. The two boys
were always together in work and play. After
a while, their parents began to think, 'This is
not good. A Christian and a Moslem should
not be such close friends. We must not let
this go on any longer.'</p>

<p>"Neither reasoning nor scolding did any
good.</p>

<p>"At last the rich boy's father, the Moslem,
decided to send him out of Turkey. 'It is
the only way to make Ibrahim forget Joannes,'
he said to himself. 'Ibrahim is now fifteen
years old. He is nearly a man. Yes, I must
send him so far away he will forget all about
his Christian playmate.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ibrahim was told of the plan. What did
he do? He rushed to Joannes's home and
said to his friend, 'I am going away, Joannes.
I must bid you good-bye.'</p>

<p>"'No, indeed,' answered Joannes. 'Where
you go, I will go, too.'</p>

<p>"'But that cannot be. My father has arranged
it so that I go into another country.
I am to serve the Pasha of Bagdad. But I
shall never forget you, Joannes. And when
I come back to this city, I shall come as your
true and loving friend.'</p>

<p>"The two boys embraced and kissed each
other. Then Ibrahim went away. Soon after
this he was sent far away to the city of Bagdad.</p>

<p>"He served the pasha so well that he soon
held a high position. Years passed away and
the pasha died. A surprise was now in store
for Ibrahim. He himself was made pasha.</p>

<p>"But he longed for his old home. He
wished to see his friend Joannes once more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
for he had never been forgotten. He sent
word to the Sultan, asking if he might visit
this city for a short time.</p>

<p>"But the Sultan said, 'No; the country
needs your care. Stay there and keep it in
order.'</p>

<p>"More years passed away. Again the
pasha asked permission to leave Bagdad that
he might visit his old home. And again the
Sultan refused.</p>

<p>"Soon after this, a strange thing happened.
The Sultan became angry with his chief officer,
the Grand Vizier. He had his head cut off,
and, would you believe it, he sent for Ibrahim
to come here to be Grand Vizier in his place.</p>

<p>"Ibrahim was hardly settled in his high
position before he sent two of his body-guard
to the narrow street where his old friend used
to live. They were told to find him and bring
him before their master.</p>

<p>"When they came to the little store of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
bread-seller, they went inside and asked for
Joannes.</p>

<p>"He came forward in a great fright. What
had he done that the Grand Vizier should send
for him? He trembled as he declared he had
done no wrong to any man, neither theft nor
murder,&mdash;no harm whatever.</p>

<p>"But the officers would not listen. Their
master had ordered Joannes to be brought to
him, and they must obey his command.</p>

<p>"He must go. There was no help. Joannes
sent a sad farewell to his wife and children,
for he fully expected he was about to meet
death. His pitying friends and neighbours
crowded around as he went with the officers
from his little store.</p>

<p>"They brought him into the presence of
the Grand Vizier. But poor Joannes did not
dare to look in his face. He threw himself
face downward on the floor, and begged that
his life should be spared.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Arise!' said the Grand Vizier. 'I do
not wish you harm. I want to talk with you.
Do you remember Ibrahim, your boy friend?'</p>

<p>"'Remember him! I loved him above all
others. But he went away, and I never saw
him again.'</p>

<p>"'I am he,' answered the great man, and he
fell on Joannes's neck and kissed him. Then
he reminded Ibrahim of the last words spoken
before they parted.</p>

<p>"'I am still your friend,' he said. 'Behold,
I will show you that I am.</p>

<p>"He sent for his accounts, and then and
there made Joannes his chief banker. He
gave him charge of all his money. He sent
him home in a grand uniform, on a fine horse,
and with servants to attend him.</p>

<p>"You can imagine the surprise of Joannes's
wife when he came home in such style.</p>

<p>"No, he had not been killed, after all. The
poor woman fainted with joy at the glad sight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
But she soon came to her senses, and both she
and her husband lived to enjoy the loving
kindness of Joannes's old friend, now the
Sultan's highest officer.</p>

<p>"That was friendship worth having, indeed."</p>

<p>"What a lovely story, papa. Maybe I
shall grow up to show Selim how much I
love him, too."</p>

<p>"It may be. Yes, it may be so. Or, possibly,
Selim will have the chance to show you
how deeply he cares for you, Osman. Who
knows what changes will come to our country?
Who knows, indeed!"</p>

<p>Osman's father became silent as he thought
of the enemies of Turkey, and of what might
happen to his loved country if they should
band together against the Sultan and his
power.</p>
